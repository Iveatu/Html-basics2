    <h1> Understanding Meal Planning</h1>
    <section>
        <p>
        To the uninitiated, meal planning can feel like an elusive practice or an overwhelming task, but that’s usually because
        we think about meal planning from the endpoint — when all the recipes have been selected, when all the groceries have
        been shopped for, and a week of dinners was successfully made. Put all the information in front of a newbie and their
        eyes grow wide with one resounding question: But how do I do it?

        What it is: Meal planning is asking the <b><em>what’s for dinner question</em></b> once for the whole week, instead of every night, and
        then shopping for and prepping the ingredients before cooking. We believe the simplest way to approach meal planning is
        with three steps.

        <ol>
            <li>Select your dinners and their recipes, if needed.</li>
            <li>Shop for ingredients.</li>
            <li>Prepare those ingredients</li>. 
            
        </ol>
        <blockquote>“Every meal should end with something sweet. Maybe it’s jelly on toast at breakfast or a small piece of chocolate at dinner – but it always helps my brain bring a close to the meal.” ~ Robert Irvine</blockquote>
